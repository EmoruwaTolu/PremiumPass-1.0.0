# PremiumPass-1.0.0
This is a draft of what the website 'Premium Pass' would look like
Upon download a folder will need to be created titled images and the names of the images you would want to display could be substituted for the names of the image files on your own device.
To view the website the file "moviesitte.html" needs to be opened in a browser, Google Chrome preferrably.
